NumPy Codes — Beginner Reference 📚

This repository contains simple, practical NumPy examples that help beginners understand how to work with arrays, numerical operations, and common data-science workflows.
I created this repo to give learners a hands-on reference they can follow while practicing — many of these examples are also explained on my LinkedIn posts so others can learn along with me.
